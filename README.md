Dotfiles
============

This is very much a work in progress.

Assumptions
-----------

These dotfiles assume you have Node.js, Pygments, virtualenvwrapper, Growl for Node by TJ Holowaychuk, Aria2 and a bunch of other stuff installed.

Installation
------------

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spitlo/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && . does install
```

You will be asked to edit the file .extras during install. Fill in as much as you can, you can always edit it again later.
